I am a PhD candidate in political science at the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), jointly organised by the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/de/) and the Department of Social Sciences at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/violeta-haas). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of political behavior, far-right parties, public policy, LGBTQ+ rights, hate crimes and social norms. Methodologically, I specialize on strategies for causal identification, quantitative approaches to the analysis of text corpora, and survey experiments. In my dissertation project, I focus on legislative changes in minority rights and how these, depending on, for instance, the social construction of target groups, affect prejudiced attitudes and behavior towards minorities.
