I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/people/violeta-haas), [Toulouse School of Economics (TSE)](https://www.tse-fr.eu). In September 2024, I completed my PhD in Political Science as part of [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics) ([Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/violeta-haas)). I was a visiting researcher at [The Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice](https://bobst.princeton.edu) and the [Department of Politics](https://politics.princeton.edu) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu). I am also involved in [The Humboldt Governance Lab (Humboldt GovLab)](https://hu-govlab.de/en/team-2/). 

My research focuses on the **political economy of crime and discrimination**. In particular, my work investigates (1) how judicial reforms affect hate crimes, (2) how policing bureaucracies strategically report about crime, and (3) how social policies targeting marginalized groups are used for political gain. My side projects include work on parties, social norms, and protest. Methodologically, I specialize in causal identification and Natural Language Processing, combining field, natural, and survey experiments, with recent advancements in AI to extract and quantify relevant concepts from unstructured text.
