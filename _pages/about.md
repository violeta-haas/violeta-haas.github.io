Hi, I am a Research Fellow at the [Insitute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/people/violeta-haas). I recently defended my PhD in Political Science in the Research Training Group [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), jointly organized by the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/de/) and the Department of Social Sciences at [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/violeta-haas). From January to May 2023, I visited [The Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice](https://bobst.princeton.edu) and the [Department of Politics](https://politics.princeton.edu) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu).

In my research, I connect insights from comparative politics and political behavior to study how institutions and elites shape inter-group relations, with a focus on gender. I also work on social norms, electoral behavior, party competition, and social movements.

In my research, I connect insights from comparative politics and political behavior to understand how institutions and elites shape inter-group relations, with a special focus on gender. My research also engages with work on social norms, electoral behavior, party competition, and social movements. Methodologically, I specialize in strategies for causal identification, quantitative approaches to analyzing text corpora, and experiments. 

On this website you can find my [publications](https://violeta-haas.github.io/publications/), download my [CV](https://violeta-haas.github.io/cv/) and find further information about my [research](https://violeta-haas.github.io/research/) and [teaching](https://violeta-haas.github.io/teaching/) profile.
