I am a PhD candidate in political science at the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), jointly organised by the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/de/) and the Department of Social Sciences at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/violeta-haas). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of political behavior, far-right parties, political violence, hate crimes and social norms. In my dissertation project, 

Methodologically, I specialize in strategies for causal identification, quantitative approaches to the analysis of text corpora, and survey experiments.
