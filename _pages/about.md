I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/people/violeta-haas), [Toulouse School of Economics (TSE)](https://www.tse-fr.eu). In September 2024, I completed my PhD in Political Science as part of [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics) ([Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/violeta-haas)). During my PhD, I was a visiting researcher at [The Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice](https://bobst.princeton.edu) and the [Department of Politics](https://politics.princeton.edu) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu). I am also involved in [The Humboldt Governance Lab (Humboldt GovLab)](https://hu-govlab.de/en/team-2/). 

My primary research focuses on **the politics of belonging**, examining how institutions and elites shape public perceptions of and behavior toward marginalized communities. Specifically, I investigate (1) how immigration salience drives bureaucrats' disclosure of sensitive information, (2) how changes in legal frameworks affect hate crimes and minority protection, and (3) the electoral consequences of elite-led mobilization against stigmatized and discriminated groups and how mainstream parties can respond. My side projects include work on party competition, social norms, and protest. Some of my work has been published or accepted for publication in *Electoral Studies* and *The Journal of Politics*. Methodologically, I specialize in causal identification and computational social science, combining field, natural, and survey experiments, with recent advancements in Natural Language Processing.
