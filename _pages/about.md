I am a PhD candidate in political science at the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), jointly organised by the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/de/) and the Department of Social Sciences at [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/violeta-haas). From January to May 2023, I visited [The Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice](https://bobst.princeton.edu) and the [Department of Politics](https://politics.princeton.edu) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu).

My research connects insights from comparative political behavior and public policy, engaging with work on sexuality and gender, transnational politics, social norms, and social movements. Methodologically, I specialize on strategies for causal identification, quantitative approaches to the analysis of text corpora, and experiments. In my dissertation project, I concentrate on unraveling the intricate ways in which legal changes in the rights of marginalized groups influence the opinions and behaviors of the broader population. Specifically, I investigate how changes in LGBTQ+ rights impact various aspects of political behavior, including shifts in voting patterns, the formation and dismantling of prejudiced attitudes, and the incidence of hate crimes.
