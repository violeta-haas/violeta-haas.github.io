I am a PhD candidate in political science at the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), jointly organised by the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/de/) and the Department of Social Sciences at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/violeta-haas). From January to May 2023, I visited [The Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice](https://bobst.princeton.edu) and the [Department of Politics](https://politics.princeton.edu) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu).

My research interests lie at the intersection of comparative political behavior, policy feedback, LGBTQ+ rights, hate crimes and social norms. Methodologically, I specialize on strategies for causal identification, quantitative approaches to the analysis of text corpora, and survey experiments. In my dissertation project, I delve into the multifaceted impact of changes in LGBTQ+ rights on various facets of society, including voting patterns, prejudiced attitudes, and discriminatory behaviors towards these communities.
