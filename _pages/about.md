This site is currently under construction :construction:

I am a PhD candidate in political science at the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), jointly organised by the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/de/) and the Department of Social Sciences at [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/violeta-haas). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of political behavior, far-right parties, public policy, hate crimes and social norms. In my dissertation project, I focus on legislative changes in minority rights and how these, depending on the social construction of target groups, affect prejudiced attitudes and behavior toward minority groups. Methodologically, I specialize in strategies for causal identification, quantitative approaches to the analysis of text corpora, and survey experiments.

On this website you can download my [CV](https://violeta-haas.github.io/cv/) and find further information about my [research](https://violeta-haas.github.io/research/) and [teaching](https://violeta-haas.github.io/teaching/) profile. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:violeta.haas@hu-berlin.de) if you are interested in my research or would like to have a chat :coffee:
