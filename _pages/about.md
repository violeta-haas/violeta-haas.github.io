I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/people/violeta-haas), [Toulouse School of Economics (TSE)](https://www.tse-fr.eu). In September 2024, I completed my PhD in Political Science as part of [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics) ([Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/violeta-haas)). I am also involved in [The Humboldt Governance Lab (Humboldt GovLab)](https://hu-govlab.de/en/team-2/). 

My research focuses on **the politics of belonging**, examining the mechanisms through which institutions and elites shape the lived experiences of marginalized groups. Focusing on immigration and LGBTQ+ rights, I investigate how (1) policy interventions and design, (2) bureaucrats' behavior, and (3) elite-led anti-minority mobilization affect perceptions of and behavior toward marginalized groups, as well as electoral competition. My other projects include work on party competition, social norms, and protest. Some of my work has been published or accepted for publication in *Electoral Studies* and *The Journal of Politics*. Methodologically, I specialize in causal identification and computational social science. I integrate traditional experimental designs (field, natural, and survey experiments) with recent advancements in multimodal LLM applications.
