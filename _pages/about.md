I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Insitute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/people/violeta-haas), and the [Toulouse School of Economics (TSE)](https://www.tse-fr.eu). In September 2024, I completed my PhD in Political Science as part of the [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics) Research Training Group, a joint initiative between the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/de/) and [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/violeta-haas). From January to May 2023, I was a visiting researcher at [The Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice](https://bobst.princeton.edu) and the [Department of Politics](https://politics.princeton.edu), through the [Initiatives on Contemporary European Affairs (ICEA)](https://icea.spia.princeton.edu/people/violeta-haas) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu). I am also involved in [The Humboldt Governance Lab (Humboldt GovLab)](https://hu-govlab.de/en/team-2/). 

In my research, I connect insights from comparative politics and political behavior to understand how institutions and elites shape public perceptions and inter-group relations, with a special focus on sexuality and gender. My research involves work on party competition, discrimination, crime, social norms and movements. Methodologically, I specialize in strategies for causal identification, Natural Language Processing, and experiments.
