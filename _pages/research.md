**1. Panic at the Courtroom: How banning the LGBTQ+ ``panic'' defense shapes the prevalence of hate crimes**. 
*Draft available upon request*
**Abstract:** Can legislative interventions protect marginalized communities? I examine whether the prohibition of the LGBTQ+ ``panic'' defense, a legal strategy that seeks to blame the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity for the defendant's violent behavior, affects the prevalence of hate crimes. Drawing on the concepts of the deterrent and expressive functions of law, I argue that legislative measures against this practice decrease the number of hate crimes in two ways. First, by directly altering the material costs of engaging in the targeted behavior. Second, by the mediating power of social norm perceptions. %standards of desirable and appropriate. To identify the causal effect of banning this practice, I leverage the gradual roll-out of LGBTQ+ ``panic'' defense bans across the US and implement a difference-in-differences design. The results show that the introduction of these bills leads to significantly lower levels of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crime rates. Besides contributing to the literature on minority politics, policy feedback and hate crime prevention, insights gained from this work are of assistance to policy makers and minority rights advocates.
