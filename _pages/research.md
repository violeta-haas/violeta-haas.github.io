**Working Papers**

**1. Panic at the Courtroom: how banning the LGBTQ+ "panic" defense shapes the prevalence of hate crimes**  
*Draft available upon request*  
**Abstract:** Can legislative interventions protect marginalized communities? I examine whether the prohibition of the LGBTQ+ "panic" defense, a legal strategy that seeks to blame the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity for the defendant's violent behavior, affects the prevalence of hate crimes. Drawing on the concepts of the deterrent and expressive functions of law, I argue that legislative measures against this practice decrease the number of hate crimes in two ways. First, by directly altering the material costs of engaging in the targeted behavior. Second, by the mediating power of social norm perceptions. To identify the causal effect of banning this practice, I leverage the gradual roll-out of LGBTQ+ "panic" defense bans across the US and implement a difference-in-differences design. The results show that the introduction of these bills leads to significantly lower levels of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crime rates. Besides contributing to the literature on minority politics, policy feedback and hate crime prevention, insights gained from this work are of assistance to policy makers and minority rights advocates.  

**2. Changing the Rules of the Game: Populists in power and constitutional retrogression**  
*Draft available upon request*  
**Abstract:** As populists rise from periphery to power, the question of whether and how these actors threaten democratic institutions becomes ever more pressing. While previous research has focused primarily on the determinants of populist electoral success and its consequences for voters, established parties, and overall democratic quality, this article examines the impact of populist parties' government participation on the most fundamental of democratic institutions, the constitution. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset, covering information on constitutional changes and populist parties across 30 European democracies (1989-2019), I investigate how the entrance of these actors into power impacts the content of constitutional redrafting. Using a series of matching and difference-in-differences models, I find no support for the notion that populists in power are going after constitutionally enshrined horizontal accountability. Neither de jure executive power nor de jure judicial independence significantly shift after populists enter the government. The same results hold when accounting for the level of constitutional rigidity. The findings make an important contribution to the literature on populist parties, constitutional change and democratic backsliding.

**Abstract:** Anti-immigration campaigns helped far right parties to establish themselves in party systems around the world. We examine whether mainstream party campaigns can reduce the appeal of far right parties by raising the salience of issues in election campaigns that divide anti-immigration voters. Issues that cross-cut the anti-immigration vote may enhance the electoral support of mainstream parties, as long as they do not simultaneously alienate pro-immigration voters. We evaluate this expectation using a novel panel survey experiment during the 2021 German federal election. The first wave allows us to identify issues that the CDU/CSU can stress to cross-cut the anti-immigration vote. The second wave raises the salience of these issues by manipulating the perceived issue agenda of the CDU/CSU using hypothetical campaign posters. We find that while this strategy does not increase vote intentions for the CDU/CSU overall, it is effective for subgroups of voters.
