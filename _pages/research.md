## **Working Papers**

**1. Panic at the Courtroom: how banning the LGBTQ+ "panic" defense shapes the prevalence of hate crimes**  
*Draft available upon request*  
> **Abstract:** Can legislative interventions protect marginalized communities? I examine whether the prohibition of the LGBTQ+ "panic" defense, a legal strategy that seeks to blame the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity for the defendant's violent behavior, affects the prevalence of hate crimes. Drawing on the concepts of the deterrent and expressive functions of law, I argue that legislative measures against this practice decrease the number of hate crimes in two ways. First, by directly altering the material costs of engaging in the targeted behavior. Second, by the mediating power of social norm perceptions. To identify the causal effect of banning this practice, I leverage the gradual roll-out of LGBTQ+ "panic" defense bans across the US and implement a difference-in-differences design. The results show that the introduction of these bills leads to significantly lower levels of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crime rates. Besides contributing to the literature on minority politics, policy feedback and hate crime prevention, insights gained from this work are of assistance to policy makers and minority rights advocates.

**2. Changing the Rules of the Game: Populists in power and constitutional retrogression**  
*Draft available upon request*  
> **Abstract:** As populists rise from periphery to power, the question of whether and how these actors threaten democratic institutions becomes ever more pressing. While previous research has focused primarily on the determinants of populist electoral success and its consequences for voters, established parties, and overall democratic quality, this article examines the impact of populist parties' government participation on the most fundamental of democratic institutions, the constitution. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset, covering information on constitutional changes and populist parties across 30 European democracies (1989-2019), I investigate how the entrance of these actors into power impacts the content of constitutional redrafting. Using a series of matching and difference-in-differences models, I find no support for the notion that populists in power are going after constitutionally enshrined horizontal accountability. Neither de jure executive power nor de jure judicial independence significantly shift after populists enter the government. The same results hold when accounting for the level of constitutional rigidity. The findings make an important contribution to the literature on populist parties, constitutional change and democratic backsliding.

**3. Beyond Accommodation: Can mainstream parties cross-cut the far right vote?**

> **Abstract:** Anti-immigration campaigns helped far right parties to establish themselves in party systems around the world. We examine whether mainstream party campaigns can reduce the appeal of far right parties by raising the salience of issues in election campaigns that divide anti-immigration voters. Issues that cross-cut the anti-immigration vote may enhance the electoral support of mainstream parties, as long as they do not simultaneously alienate pro-immigration voters. We evaluate this expectation using a novel panel survey experiment during the 2021 German federal election. The first wave allows us to identify issues that the CDU/CSU can stress to cross-cut the anti-immigration vote. The second wave raises the salience of these issues by manipulating the perceived issue agenda of the CDU/CSU using hypothetical campaign posters. We find that while this strategy does not increase vote intentions for the CDU/CSU overall, it is effective for subgroups of voters.

## **Work in Progress**

**4. The electoral effects of elite-led anti-LGBTQ mobilization**  
-- with [Tarik Abou-Chadi](https://www.tarikabouchadi.net/), [Lukas Stoetzer](http://lukas-stoetzer.org/), and [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com/) -- 
> **Abstract:** Does elite-led anti-LGBTQ mobilization bolster the political fortunes of the radical-right? While a growing body of literature documents the increasing politicization of LGBTQ- and gender-related issues by conservative elites, few studies have analyzed the electoral effects of these strategies. In particular, whether legal acts of social exclusion activate and mobilize supporters of radical-right parties, remains largely unknown. To answer this question, we study the introduction of anti-LGBTQ resolutions in many Polish municipalities prior to the 2020 Polish presidential election. Our empirical strategy relies on a series of difference-in-differences and synthetic control models, and finds no clear evidence that anti-LGBTQ resolutions increased the support for the radical-right Law and Justice party. To the contrary, the evidence suggest that anti-LGBTQ resolutions mobilized support for the opposed Civic platform. Overall, this study's findings are relevant for understanding the electoral consequences of elite-led mobilization against stigmatized or discriminated groups, as well as the politics of social exclusion more broadly.

**5. Does Strategic Portfolio Allocation Pay Off? The electoral effects of issue yield orientated portfolio allocation**  
> **Abstract:** Are coalition parties who strategically allocate their portfolios according to electoral opportunities rewarded at the polls? While scholars have extensively discussed the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of portfolio allocation, relatively little is known about the electoral consequences of holding specific ministerial posts. The present study seeks to close this gap by investigating the electoral effects of issue yield orientated portfolio allocation. More specifically, I argue that coalition parties benefit electorally from controlling portfolios that cover policy areas characterized by a high ability to mobilize core voters while simultaneously broadening the base of support. I test my argument using an original dataset covering a total of 122 parties in 17 European countries between 1991 and 2017. The results of a multilevel linear regression analysis suggest that the extent to which a coalition party manages to optimally allocate its ministries according to issue yield theory positively affects their vote share at the next election. The present paper contributes to a systematic and comparatively informed discussion on both cabinet formation in coalition governments in general and portfolio allocation as a vote-maximizing strategy of political actors in particular.
