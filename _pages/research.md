        How can governments ensure voters' support for unpopular policies? Policymakers often have to implement policies that are unpopular in local communities, such as the construction of windmills or nuclear power plants. However, little is known about how policymakers can increase local support. We argue that perceived economic benefits increase support for otherwise unpopular policies. We test our argument by studying the consequences of nuclear power plants on support for the Green Party in Germany, a strong opponent of nuclear energy. We collected a novel dataset on the geographic location of nuclear plants and voting records since the 1980s. Using difference-in-differences and instrumental variable designs, we find that the opening of nuclear power plants has a negative effect on the vote share of the Greens. Additional individual-level panel analyses suggest that this effect is driven by economic considerations. Overall, these results are relevant for the study of energy transitions and the design of unpopular policies more generally.

**Panic at the Courtroom: Can Legislative Action against Discrimination in Court Reduce Violence?**  
*Draft available upon request*  
> **Abstract:** Can legislative measures against discrimination in court reduce bias-motivated behavior? This study examines the impact of criminal code reforms that prohibit the LGBTQ+ “panic” defense—a legal strategy that attributes a defendant’s violent actions to a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity—on the incidence of hate crimes. I argue that such reforms operate through two primary mechanisms: first, by increasing the material costs of engaging in bias-motivated violence through heightened legal sanctions, and second, by signaling institutional disaprovement of violence as a means of enforcing heteronormative and masculinity norms. To assess the causal effect of these reforms, I exploit the staggered adoption of LGBTQ+ “panic” defense bans across U.S. states and employ a difference-in-differences design. The findings indicate that states implementing these bans experience a significant reduction in anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes. This study advances scholarship on minority rights, policy feedback, and the criminal justice system by demonstrating how legal reforms shape social norms and constrain bias-driven violence. The results also have direct implications for policymakers and advocates seeking to mitigate hate crimes through judicial and legislative interventions.

**The Electoral Effects of State-Sponsored Homophobia**      
-- with [Konstantin Bogatyrev](https://sites.google.com/view/konstantin-bogatyrev/), [Tarik Abou-Chadi](https://www.tarikabouchadi.net/), [Lukas Stoetzer](http://lukas-stoetzer.org/), and [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com/) --  
*R&R*  
> **Abstract:**  Do strategies of state-sponsored homophobia translate into electoral gains? While a growing body of literature documents the increasing politicization of LGBTQ- and gender-related issues by illiberal elites, little is known about the electoral effects of these strategies. We address this important question by studying whether anti-LGBTQ mobilization pays off electorally for the initiating party. Empirically, we study the adoption of anti-LGBTQ resolutions in many Polish municipalities prior to the 2019 parliamentary election. Using a synthetic difference-in-differences design, we find that the adoption of anti-LGBTQ resolutions increased support for the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party while decreasing opposition parties’ ability to mobilize in affected municipalities. Overall, this study’s findings are relevant for understanding the electoral consequences of both elite-led mobilization against stigmatized and discriminated groups, as well as policies of subnational democratic backsliding.

**Does Protest Affect Bystanders? Field Experimental Evidence**   
-- with [Daniel Bischof](https://www.danbischof.com), [Ferdinand Geissler](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/de/lehrbereiche/empisoz/a-z/geisslerferdinand), [Johannes Giesecke](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/de/lehrbereiche/empisoz/a-z/giesecke), [Felix Hartmann](http://hartmannfelix.github.io), [Macartan Humphreys](https://macartan.github.io), [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com/), [Lukas Stoetzer](http://lukas-stoetzer.org/), and [Tim Wappenhans](https://www.timwappenhans.com) --  
> **Abstract:** Despite decades of scholarship on protest effects, we know little about how bystanders, citizens who merely observe protests without participating, are affected by them. Understanding the impact of protest on bystanders is crucial as they constitute the silent majority whose latent support, normative beliefs, and concrete actions can make or break a movement's broader societal impact. We address this gap with a novel field experiment in Berlin, Germany, randomly routing pedestrians past \emph{(treatment)} or away from \emph{(control)} three large-scale Fridays for Future (FFF) climate strikes. Additionally, we conducted a one-month follow-up to assess the persistence of effects. We find no detectable impact on climate attitudes, vote intentions, or norm perceptions but a substantial increase in immediate donations to climate causes. These results suggest that protest is more likely to influence bystanders through immediate behavioral cues than through changes in attitudes or norms. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption in both scholarship and public discourse that protests reshape public opinion in a direct and unmediated way, calling for renewed theorizing of protest effects that centers on observers' immediate behavioral activation rather than just opinion change mechanisms.

**Electoral Responses to Local Cooperations with Radical-Right Parties**      
-- with [Phillip Heyna](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/heyna), [Hanno Hilbig](https://www.hannohilbig.com), [Tim Wappenhans](https://www.timwappenhans.com) --  
> **Abstract:**  Electoral gains by radical-right parties have sparked intense debate over whether mainstream parties should engage in cooperative arrangements with them. While existing research has concentrated on national-level cooperations in the form of government participation and programmatic accommodation, systematic and causal evidence on local-level cooperation remains sparse. Yet, the local political arena, we argue, may constitute a distinct strategic environment wherein cooperation is often driven by pragmatic governance imperatives rather than ideological affinity. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on German municipal legislatures, where mainstream parties have occasionally collaborated with the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Using newly collected data on six different types of cooperative engagement between 2019 and 2024, we employ both a standard two-period difference-in-differences and a synthetic difference-in-differences approach to assess the electoral consequences of such cooperations. We find preliminary evidence that cooperations are associated with significant subsequent losses in electoral support for the AfD, with more pronounced penalties when the cooperation is highly visible. We theorize that these effects may stem from (i) a reduction in the AfD's anti-establishment appeal, (ii) a shift in voter attention from ideologically polarizing issues to pragmatic concerns of local governance, and (iii) the enhancement of mainstream parties’ reputational signals of competence. To explore these mechanisms, we use a large language model (GPT-4.1) to analyze over 70,000 local news articles referencing the AfD, systematically extracting information on party portrayals, issue salience, and cooperation narratives.

## **Selected Work in Progress**  
<!--- **Same in all but name? The effects of same-sex partnership recognition rights on public attitudes: Experimental Evidence**    
> **Abstract:** Do parallel institutions promote backlash against marginalized groups? While observational studies regularly find marriage equality to increase support for gays and lesbians, same-sex registered partnership tends to either be unrelated or even promote prejudiced attitudes and behavior. In this preregistered survey experiment, I study the individual level mechanism underlying this phenomenon. I argue that integrating minorities into existing benefits will positively affect attitudes toward these groups and increase support for the proposed policy by decreasing perceptions of (a) inter-group differences, (b) realistic, but not symbolic, threat, and (c) a minority-oriented policy motivation. Yet, I predict this effect to be weaker for the introduction of exclusive new benefits. To test my expectations, I run an experimental vignette study in Turkey (N=1500) and randomly assign respondents to one of two hypothetical scenarios (i.e., extension to marriage equality versus introduction of same-sex registered partnership rights) or a control condition. The results have important implications for the broader literature on minority rights and policy feedback, as well as for policy makers that seek ways to prevent backlash.
